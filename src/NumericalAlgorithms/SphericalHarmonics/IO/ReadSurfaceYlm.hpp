/*!
 * \brief Similar to `ylm::read_surface_ylm`, this reads in spherical harmonic
 * data for a surface and constructs a `ylm::Strahlkorper`. However, this
 * function only does it at a specific time and returns a single
 * `ylm::Strahlkorper`.
 *
 * \note If two times are found within \p epsilon of the \p time, then an error
 * will occur. Similarly, if no \p time is found within the \p epsilon, then an
 * error will occur as well.
 *
 * \param file_name name of the H5 file containing the surface's spherical
 * harmonic data
 * \param surface_subfile_name name of the subfile (with no leading slash nor
 * the `.dat` extension) within `file_name` that contains the surface's
 * spherical harmonic data to read in
 * \param time Time to read the coefficients at.
 * \param epsilon How much error is allowed when looking for a specific time.
 * This is useful so users don't have to know the specific time to machine
 * precision.
